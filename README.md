### About Me ###
Hi, I’m Sam Kelemen, a computer science student passionate about software engineering, high-performance computing, and machine learning. My favorite language is C++. I enjoy building projects that push me beyond the classroom, from my stock exchange simulation engine, built with high performant C++ architecture and programming paradigms, to time-series analysis and machine learning with big data. My goal is to keep growing as an engineer by tackling challenging problems and working with talented people.
